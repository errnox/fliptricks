# Fliptricks

Technically, this is a game. You are a tile. You start at the origin, you can move around, you can jump and when you fall off the wrong edge, you die.

**Arrow keys** to move around, **space** to jump and **WASD** to move the camera.

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is used for the graphics.
